## From code

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. Optionally switch to node 6.9.2, because this is currently developped with this version:
```
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n 6.9.2
```

Install from source:
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-desktop
# Go into the repository
cd ark-desktop
# Install dependencies 
npm install
```

* In some cases, [node-hid](https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid) doesn't provide pre-built binaries, so is necessary to install the [node-hid dependencies](https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid#compiling-from-source) to build them from source before running `npm install`.

Then start:
```bash
npm start
```

## Necessary to package from Mac OS X

```
brew tap Homebrew/bundle
brew bundle
```
