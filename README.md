## Pinned: Critical bugs only!
Since we are working on the next-gen version of the wallet, we won't be reviewing pull requests with new features and bugs (only critical bugs will be reviewed and merged). Our intention is deploying the first beta of the v2 desktop wallet in a few weeks time so we need to be focused on it exclusively.

Please do not submit Pull-Requests (PRs) unless they solve an urgent problem.

## Pinned: Help us with translations
Collaborate with other translators on our OneSky project and help us get wallet translated in other languages  http://osjc1wl.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project?id=95031

Please do not submit Pull-Requests (PRs) for translations, but use the link above!

## Build

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. Optionally switch to node 6.9.2, because this is currently developed with this version:
```
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n 6.9.2
```

Install from source:
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-desktop
# Go into the repository
cd ark-desktop
# Install dependencies 
npm install
```

* In some cases, [node-hid](https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid) doesn't provide pre-built binaries, so is necessary to install the [node-hid dependencies](https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid#compiling-from-source) to build them from source before running `npm install`.

Then start:
```bash
npm start
```

### Requirements to build from OS X

```
brew tap Homebrew/bundle
brew bundle
```
