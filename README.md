## Translations

Translations are part of our [ARK Development and Security Bounty Program](https://blog.ark.io/ark-development-and-security-bounty-program-a95122d06879).

Full translations are considered to be `Tier 3`, while grammar fixes, typos, etc. are considered to be `Tier 6`.

<details><summary>Full translations should involve 5 tasks</summary>

 - Create a pull request for the language you are going to translate. If you have doubts about something, use English to explain them.
 - Translate the textual content of the application, using the [English language file](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/desktop-wallet/blob/develop/src/renderer/i18n/locales/en-US.js) as the reference. To do that, a new file, with the language locale code should be created. The name of the file should be a valid [RFC 5646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646) and should be located at `src/renderer/i18n/locales/LANGUAGE.js`. Thanks to [vue-i18n-extract](https://github.com/pixari/vue-i18n-extract), it is possible to execute `yarn i18n src/renderer/i18n/locales/LANGUAGE.js` to find suggestions of missing translations.
 - Add the language to the [English language file](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/desktop-wallet/blob/develop/src/renderer/i18n/locales/en-US.js) at the `LANGUAGES` key.
 - Update the [date and time formats file](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/desktop-wallet/blob/develop/src/renderer/i18n/date-time-formats.js) to include the short and long format that are used commonly by native speakers.
 - Update the [number formats file](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/desktop-wallet/blob/develop/src/renderer/i18n/number-formats.js) to include the preferred way of displaying currencies used commonly by native speakers.
 - Add the language at the `I18N.enabledLocales` array at the [main configuration file](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/desktop-wallet/blob/develop/config/index.js). This step is necessary to make the language available.
 - Execute the application. Go to the [development section](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/desktop-wallet#development) to learn how to install the requirements and execute it.
