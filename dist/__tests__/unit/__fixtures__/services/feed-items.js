Today, we are proud to announce the next addition to the ARK family. Please say hello to our newest Core Developer — Joshua Noack. Joshua will be joining the ARK team full-time starting today, 3rd of September 2018.</strong></p><p>Joshua has been a programmer for most of his life. His interest in programming began back in 2005 when he discovered the RPG Maker XP and learned Ruby. From there, he experimented with a lot of different languages and frameworks. From Gosu, a Ruby gem for 2D game development, to HTML5 game development via Phaser, and finally to C++/ GDScript using Godot Engine. Game development was the catalyst which made him fall in love with programming. In 2009, he discovered Linux and was soon absorbed into the open source world, compiling Gentoo, and breaking things until settling with ArchLinux.</p><p>He became more professionally involved 5 years ago as a .NET developer for Software IT house in Germany. During that time, he learned to work reliably, even when under stress and through critical times. Some of his responsibilities included every aspect of code, ranging from back-end to front-end development, writing documentation, and providing technical support. As a result, he became a versatile developer who knows how each stage of development is handled and completed. During this time, he learned Visual C#, VB.NET, MySQL, SQLite, Git, Jira and much more.</p><p>After the initial job, Joshua continued his work for one of the companies developing embedded devices. He developed a serial communication protocol which was also used to implement a remote scripting interface to run automated tests in a production facility. This experience is indicative of following modern programming practices, which includes writing well tested and documented code - a necessity when dealing with sensitive projects like blockchain protocols, where preparing proper testing suites can save not just time, but can prevent an unrecoverable situation.</p><p>Before joining ARK, Joshua worked as a full-time developer on C++/Qt embedded systems. He created a custom Yocto Linux distribution and ported one of their older systems to a newer technology stack which included C, C++, Qt, Python, tons of shell scripts, systemd, PostgreSQL, SQLite and dealt with Makefiles, showing his work with a lot of low-level as well as high-level programming languages.</p><p>Last year he took cryptography and security related courses, and continued to invest a lot of his spare time to learn, master, and contribute to open-source development. Here, he found his new home at ARK by participating in the GitHub Development Bounty Program. With his contributions, he showed the experience, knowledge, and code quality that is essential when dealing with sensitive projects like our new ARK Core.</p><p>Joshua is eager to start hammering away at our Core code and we are delighted to have him. Joshua, welcome to the ARK crew and your new family.</p><p><strong><em>Follow us on social media ( </em></strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ArkEcosystem"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a><strong><em> | </em></strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArkEcosystem/"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><strong><em> | </em></strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/arkecosystem"><strong><em>Reddit</em></strong></a><strong><em> ), join our community ( </em></strong><a href="https://ark.io/slack"><strong><em>Slack</em></strong></a><strong><em> | </em></strong><a href="https://discord.ark.io"><strong><em>Discord</em></strong></a><strong><em> ) and stay tuned to our blog on </em></strong><a href="https://blog.ark.io/"><strong><em>Medium</em></strong></a><strong><em> and on </em></strong><a href="https://steemit.com/@arkecosystem"><strong><em>Steemit</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=91fe22951789" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.ark.io/say-hello-to-arks-newest-full-time-core-developer-joshua-noack-91fe22951789">Say Hello to ARKs Newest Full-Time Core Developer — Joshua Noack</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.ark.io">ARK.io | Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>',

We would like to thank all who have already joined to help test the new Core! As always, we would like to invite everyone else that has yet to participate to join and help out as well.</strong></p><p>The new DevNet utilizing ARK Core v2 was launched <a href="https://blog.ark.io/ark-core-v2-devnet-is-live-66c1023ff7d3">2 weeks ago</a>. Since then we have fixed several bugs and implemented many new features based on community input. In addition, we have also begun testing dynamic fees and higher network throughput.</p><h4><strong>Changes In Numbers</strong></h4><p>Over the course of last 14 days there were:</p><ul><li><strong>10 different developers </strong>contributing to the Core.</li><li><strong>53 commits</strong> to the Core repository.</li><li><strong>166 files changed</strong> in the Core repository.</li><li><strong>978 lines of code deleted</strong> from the Core.</li><li><strong>3,561 lines of code added</strong> to the Core.</li></ul><h4>Testing</h4><p>We have begun testing dynamic fees on DevNet. Every delegate can now chose their minimum acceptable fee depending on the transaction type. Here is an example of a normal transaction with a set fee of only <strong>0.00000275 DѦ. </strong>Prior to this, v1 fees were set at a static 0.1 DѦ.</p><p><em>Example of a TX with Dynamic Fees as low as 0.00000275: </em><a href="https://dexplorer.ark.io/transaction/3585ce1b6840f6e2c63a1c5c6cbe2877ae95555030d917f3d32027d8f44254c4">https://dexplorer.ark.io/transaction/3585ce1b6840f6e2c63a1c5c6cbe2877ae95555030d917f3d32027d8f44254c4</a></p><p>Another item under testing is milestone offset by height in the configuration file. A new milestone was set at block height 21,600 and from this block forward the chain started to accept blocks with up to <strong>150 transactions per block. </strong>This is a large increase from the previous default of 50 TPB (which is currently the same as MainNet). This successful transition has shown a solid increase of 3x in Transactions Per Second, bringing the previous 6.25 TPS to 18.75 TPS. While we are all very excited about this successful jump, please remember that we are still testing and these numbers are subject to change. The final throughput could be higher or lower for MainNet, and more testing is needed before finalizing any TPS numbers.</p><p><em>Example of a block with 150 TX in it:<br></em><a href="https://dexplorer.ark.io/block/4486277915989266225">https://dexplorer.ark.io/block/4486277915989266225</a></p><h4>New Features</h4><ul><li><strong>Blockchain ready plugin for P2P API</strong> — new plugin for the P2P API that returns a 503 Service Unavailable on certain endpoints that require the blockchain to be ready. For v1 endpoints it will return 200 Success with a body of { success: false } because that is how it was handled in the legacy P2P API where there is no proper use of status codes.</li><li><strong>P2P Config API</strong> — adds a new config endpoint under <a href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/config">http://0.0.0.0:4000/config</a>, where 4000 is the P2P port of the corresponding network, meaning it can vary between main, dev and testnet. It exposes information like versions of core and the network and other detailed information about plugins and their state.</li><li><strong>Immutable storage </strong>—provides an immutable storage in the form of the new package core-storage. This package makes use of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/</a> under the hood so everything that can be done by immutable.js can also be done with core-storage. core-storage only is a wrapper around immutable.js in order to make it possible to have a shared instance for in-memory information that all plugins and the core itself can access at any time without having to worry about the data in it getting modified without being told to do so. This storage can be used for peers, wallets, blockchain state, blocks and other items where the data needs to stay as initially stored.</li><li><strong>Criteria based peer suspensions and offender banning </strong>—The previous ban system was quite harsh, not taking the type of offense into account to implement a ban. In order to make a better assessment with regard to peer violations we have implemented the __determineSuspensionTime method. Checks will be performed on the peer in question to determine a fair ban time for each cause of trouble instead of flat out banning for 5+ hours. Previous offences are now taken into account and an offence weight is determined. If a total of 100 offence weight is reached a peer will be banned for 1 day as it is deemed to be a repeat offender.</li><li><strong>Setting slot height </strong>— makes it possible to set the height in the slot module of the crypto package.</li><li><strong>Enabled CORS for P2P post transactions endpoint </strong>— this is to match v1 transactions endpoint. Currently, the /peer/transactions endpoint is used in v1 to post transactions.</li><li><strong>Internal event emitting via P2P API </strong>—when the forger and relay were launched separately the emitted events would never reach the relay as the relay and forger were isolated. This will emit the given event via API to make sure the relay will be notified.</li><li><strong>Log usernames in forger (via P2P API)</strong> — adds the ability to log usernames in the forger as previously it did not have access to that data.</li><li><strong>Return broadcast IDs for better feedback</strong> —the v2 endpoint only returned IDs of accept, excess or invalid transactions. If a server doesn’t have dynamic fees enabled transactions will be broadcasted until a node is found that will forge it, but the user would not know that the transaction is being broadcasted instead of being immediately accepted.</li><li><strong>Tester CLI tweaks on v2 endpoints </strong>— updated Tester CLI to use only v2 endpoints, and some other small changes to the Tester.</li></ul><h4>Fixed Bugs</h4><ul><li><strong>Fixed transaction processing </strong>— there was an issue with the vote test. Also issues with multi-sig because the fee is (keysgroup + 1) * fee, but the guard was only comparing the tx fee with the fee constant.</li><li><strong>Fixed blockchain not ready for usernames </strong>—if a request would be sent to the P2P API to get usernames before the node is synced it would throw a 500. This handles it by returning a response with a message.</li><li><strong>Cast port number when filtering peers </strong>— some peers in the peer list had the port stored as a string. We’ve added a forced-cast when filtering a specific peer on the v1 endpoint (/api/v1/peers/get) just as a precaution.</li><li><strong>Fixed delegate voters endpoint 500 error</strong> — if a delegate wasn’t found on the v1 endpoint /api/v1/delegates/voters, it threw a 500 error. The changes now return success: true and an empty array (which matches current MainNet).</li><li><strong>Fixed new delegate not updating</strong> —when a wallet user registers a new delegate name, it is not indexed in the wallet manager. This means that when the vote weight is recalculated at the end of each round, that wallet is not included. This has now been resolved.</li><li><strong>Post transaction endpoint to closer match v1 </strong>— previously the response from /peer/transactions always returns successful even with invalid transactions. This changes the response and brings the values more in-line with the v1 endpoint.</li><li><strong>Pagination v2 fixes </strong>— issues with paginated endpoints (E.g. orderBy missing, limit max not set) have been resolved.</li><li><strong>Fixed cast port number in peer list to number</strong> —the peer list has inconsistent JSON — all endpoints; /peer/list, /api/peers and /api/v2/peers. This causes issues for SDKs (e.g. C++) that require strict type mappings, where it is impossible for a value to be both a string or an integer.</li><li><strong>Fixed return empty object instead of array</strong> — returns an empty object to match the type of walletsByAddress.</li><li><strong>Fixed delete ID query parameter to prevent faulty query for votes</strong> — The ID parameter from the path was causing an incorrect query to be generated when requesting.</li><li><strong>Fixed sending too many requests to relays in forger </strong>—the forger was sending wake-up signals to all relays instead of choosing one, thereby causing excess requests resulting in missing blocks in certain cases.</li><li><strong>Return peer height on v2 endpoints </strong>— return height of peers when accessing v2 endpoints.</li><li><strong>Fixes on rebuilding MainNet </strong>— with changes to the v2 code, query has changed with code updates so it has been modified to be able to rebuild MainNet.</li><li><strong>Fixed bad method call on suspended peers endpoint </strong>— the suspended peers endpoint did not work due to calling non-existent methods.</li><li><strong>Launch P2P server before pinging peers</strong> — swapping the order in which the P2P server is started. The previous order meant that the node would try to connect with peers before its own server is online. This results in other peers trying to ping the server that is not online yet, resulting in it being suspended.</li><li><strong>Fixed core-p2p tests and added package to jest config.</strong></li><li><strong>Fixed changed logic in getRandomPeer &gt; keys.filter, was too permissive.</strong></li></ul><h4>Refactoring and Other Commits</h4><ul><li><strong>Keeping the relay that responded to syncCheck and syncCall, until forging is done </strong>— using the relay that responded to synCheck and making sure the relay is synced. Also no host changing between getting network state and transaction from pool. This saves time, sticking with the host that responded and is synced.</li><li><strong>Webhooks queue and tests </strong>— removes the use of a Redis queue for the Webhooks. Now they are immediately sent out.

This update will apply to the ARK MainNet and will take care of some of the bugs and potential security vulnerabilities that we have identified in testing.</strong></p><h3><strong>Note: this update is only relevant to those running relay and delegate nodes (regular users DO NOT have to do anything).</strong></h3><h3>THIS IS NOT A V2 UPDATE.</h3><h4>This will bring the V1 codebase from 1.0.3 to 1.1.0.</h4><p>This should be the last version we will be releasing for our legacy ARK Node codebase for V1 on MainNet. Of course, if we find any new security threats we will request another update from all of the delegates/relays.</p><h3>How to Update?</h3><p>Again, this update is ONLY relevant for anyone running an active or relay node (delegates or those running relay nodes to support the network/running for their own solutions).</p><p>To update simply follow the below instructions:</p><ol><li>Login to your server with you credentials</li><li>Start ARKcommander.sh script by running:</li></ol><pre>bash ARKcommander.sh</pre><p>Once asked, input your <strong>sudo password</strong> for the user you have logged in with.</p><p>In case you are not sure if you have the latest version you can remove the previous one and download the latest one by following these commands:</p><pre>rm ARKcommander.sh<br>wget <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArkEcosystem/ARKcommander/master/ARKcommander.sh">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArkEcosystem/ARKcommander/master/ARKcommander.sh</a><br>bash ARKcommander.sh</pre><p>3. In the upper section you’ll see a nice message - “<em>New update available press ‘3’ to update</em>”. Press number ‘3’ and ‘enter’ to start the update process. The node will be updated with the latest release from GitHub. After the update has been completed, press ‘enter’ to restart your node.</p><p>4. If you are running a delegate on mainnet you will need to set the passphrase for your node as the config will be rewritten with the empty one due to the bump version from 1.0.3 to 1.1.0. To do that in the ARKCommander simply press ‘5’ and ‘enter’ (<em>Set/Reset Secret</em>) and paste in your delegate passphrase.</p><p>5. Once updated (and passphrase set for active delegates) and back in the menu simply press ‘L’ and ‘enter’ to open real-time logs.</p><h4>What does this update bring?</h4><p>This update has taken care of several security vulnerabilities in the current codebase and implemented improved checks for added security:</p><ul><li>Disabled some of the endpoints that could be used to crash nodes and get them to miss blocks (active delegates)</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause votes &amp; delegates to be duplicated (adding unique constraints in the DB)</li><li>Fixed an issue where blocks were processed before they were verified</li><li>Fixed a timestamp (time-travel) overflow issue</li><li>Fixed some logging issues where data was missing</li><li>Implemented stricter validation of vote data</li><li>Fixed an issue that could result in transaction pool spam</li><li>Fixed an issue that could result in duplicated transactions in the pool</li></ul><p>This update should mitigate the remaining known security vulnerabilities in ARK Core v1 and leave a better, more secure legacy codebase for those who choose to use it. All updates relevant to this Core v1 patch are non-issues in the new ARK Core v2 codebase and do not require an update of devnet.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3da3aa494b32" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.ark.io/new-version-of-ark-node-available-for-mainnet-3da3aa494b32">New Version of ARK Node Available for MainNet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.ark.io">ARK.io | Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>',

Today, we are announcing our official partnership with Marachain to bring the secure exchange of GDPR-compliant digital documents to the blockchain. As part of our partnership, Marachain will be using the ARK platform as the basis for their custom blockchain solution and will contribute to the development of our custom IPFS module.</strong></p><p>As of May 25th of this year, the European Union (EU) issued a new series of regulatory standards known as the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR. These regulations have a major impact on how both individuals and businesses transmit digital information and protect the private data of customers. The GDPR protects citizens’ personal data and applies not only to European businesses, but anyone doing business in the European territory or handling private data of EU citizens.</p><p>For many businesses, this forced a stringent review of data privacy practices and implementation of new procedures to avoid severe sanctions that can amount to four percent of annual revenue or four million euros, whichever is higher. For the average user and small business owner, a simplified solution is necessary for transmitting data, while staying within the guidelines of the GDPR. By utilizing the power of the ARK blockchain platform and IPFS, Marachain looks to provide that solution.</p><p>MARAChain allows transmission of encrypted and secure documentation, restricting access to third parties and offering access management to these creditable transfers, through an auditable, verifiable and secure P2P transaction. These transmissions will be made through a distributed network of nodes located in the main European DPCs, which guarantees 24/7 availability of information as well as protection against information loss thanks to the redundancy of the MARAChain network.</p><blockquote>A.J. Mélian, Founder and CEO of Marachain had the following to say about the partnership:</blockquote><blockquote>“After extensive analysis of the features of the top blockchain technologies available in the market today, we have concluded that ARK best fulfills the requirements for Marachain. In our view, ARK has the potential to become the blockchain ecosystem for high-security data environments, as required for compliance with the EU-GDPR regulations. This, in combination with the professionalism of the organisation and people behind ARK, is why MARAChain has chosen to collaborate with ARK to develop the future of Secure Exchange of Digital Documents.”</blockquote><p>ARK is excited to welcome MARAChain to the family and will be providing full support to the MARAChain team as they begin to implement the ARK technology stack to power their decentralized application. MARAChain offers a dedicated and professional team and brings a strong, industry-first use case that will help grow the ARK Ecosystem, as well as provide a new and innovative service to our community.</p><blockquote>For more information about MARAChain, visit their website at <a href="https://marachain.eu">https://MARAChain.eu</a></blockquote><blockquote>You can read their whitepaper here: <a href="https://www.marachain.eu/uploads/2018/03/Whitepaper.pdf">https://www.marachain.eu/uploads/2018/03/Whitepaper.pdf</a></blockquote><p>Stay tuned for more information, announcements, and our AMA with the MARAChain team.</p><p><strong><em>Follow us on social media ( </em></strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ArkEcosystem"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a><strong><em> | </em></strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArkEcosystem/"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><strong><em> | </em></strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/arkecosystem"><strong><em>Reddit</em></strong></a><strong><em> ), join our community ( </em></strong><a href="https://ark.io/slack"><strong><em>Slack</em></strong></a><strong><em> | </em></strong><a href="https://discord.ark.io"><strong><em>Discord</em></strong></a><strong><em> ) and stay tuned to our blog on </em></strong><a href="https://blog.ark.io/"><strong><em>Medium</em></strong></a><strong><em> and on </em></strong><a href="https://steemit.com/@arkecosystem"><strong><em>Steemit</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cb926e80303f" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.ark.io/building-an-ecosystem-ark-announces-partnership-with-marachain-cb926e80303f">Building an Ecosystem: ARK Announces Partnership with MARAChain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.ark.io">ARK.io | Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>',

Our newest partnership will bring access to crypto-backed ‘credits’, allowing users to borrow fiat money by using ARK as collateral. This will also grant access to Ø credit and debit cards giving users instant access to holdings.</strong></p><p>Ø Crypto Union aims to become the world’s first decentralized bank by leveraging the limitless potential created by blockchain technology. It is a versatile project that is composed of three main services: “Ø Pay”, “Ø Invest” and “Ø Lift”. Ø Pay will be the main feature that ARK users will be able to test and make use of.</p><h3><strong><em>What is ØPay?</em></strong></h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RCXbjttdmgf8BTJHovqXvw.png" /><figcaption>ØPay Mobile App</figcaption></figure><p>Ø Pay allows you to leverage your investments using crypto-backed credit from a fully licensed financial institution, with accreditations pending in Malta. Pay for anything anywhere via a custom credit card and maximize the utility of your cryptocurrencies. By depositing your ARK coins as collateral into the secure vault, you can instantly use your new line of credit while keeping the benefits of staking your coins.</p><p>Ø Crypto Union is currently in the process of obtaining the ELMI/EMI (Electronic Money Institution) and the MTF (Multilateral Trading Facility) licenses from the Malta government.</p><h3><strong>What does this mean for ARK holders?</strong></h3><p>As part of our partnership, we are assisting with the integration of ARK into Ø’s platform so ARK users can directly benefit from this payment gateway. ARK will be among the first communities to be exposed to full financial capability and direct payment methods including asset-backed loans.</p><p>Additionally, the Ø Crypto Union team will be selecting several ARK community members to become ‘Beta Testers’ of their platform, with ARK integration and testing set to begin in September. In return, testers will get a membership in Ø Crypto Union free of charge!</p><p>Beta testing of credit and debit cards will start in October, and this will open the door to instant fiat access in various denominations such as EUR to start, with GBP and USD launching at a later time.</p><h3><strong>How does it work?</strong></h3><p>The Ø Pay system has been designed to keep things as simple as possible. As an ARK holder, you will be able to deposit your tokens into the ØPay platform and immediately get 40% of your ARK’s value in fiat as a line of credit, collateralized by your ARK holdings. You can then start spending that fiat without actually selling your ARK. The ARK acts as collateral, so if you cannot repay the line of credit, it can be used as a liquidation method. More details are forthcoming, but voting for delegates on your behalf will be possible, along with the ability for you to receive a portion of the forging rewards.</p><h3><strong><em>What is Ø Invest?</em></strong></h3><p>Ø Invest will grant you access to an internal exchange platform (ØDEX) which provides 100% liquidity through Ø exchange, as well as investment opportunities in the form of tokenized exotic financial products, such as Ø DA, a stable asset-backed token and Ø CB, a token backed by crypto loans.</p><h3><strong><em>What is Ø Lift?</em></strong></h3><p>Ø Lift promotes tailor-made services, including asset management, tax optimization, and others. Ø Crypto Union has an in-house team of renowned legal and financial specialists. This team, together with the community, will deliver massive value to members.</p><p>We are excited to partner with Ø Crypto Union to expand the ARK Ecosystem and provide new and innovative ways for our users to utilize and leverage their ARK tokens. Stay tuned to our blog for more details as we get closer to the September testing phase and the subsequent launch of ARK based services by the Ø Crypto Union team!</p><blockquote>To learn more about Ø Crypto Union visit <a href="https://ocryptounion.io">https://ocryptounion.io</a> or read their whitepaper at <a href="https://ocryptounion.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/The-Big-Bang-of-Banking.pdf">https://ocryptounion.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/The-Big-Bang-of-Banking.pdf</a> .</blockquote><h3><strong>Questions?</strong></h3><p>We will be hosting an AMA (Ask Me Anything) with Ø’s team to answer any questions regarding their platform and integration in early September.

Our newest hire is Erwann Gentric.</em></strong></p><p>Erwann has been on our radar for some time now having been active in our <a href="https://blog.ark.io/ark-github-development-bounty-113806ae9ffe"><strong>GitHub Development Bounty Program</strong></a>. His enthusiasm and willingness to help already show in his implementation of cool new features in the ARK mobile wallet (BIP39 passphrase validation, word suggestion, word hide while typing, …) and he is always reaching out to ask if there is work to do and reveals himself as exactly what we look for in developers. He is hard working, self-incentivized and a self-learning individual.</p><p>Erwann graduated from INSA Lyon (France) engineering school in 2013 where he studied Computer Science with a focus on Software Development. During that time, he started dabbling in web development and Javascript with side-projects and internships. He also spent a year at Universidad de Barcelona (Spain) studying business. He is very passionate about new tech innovations and how they can improve people’s lives, and he truly believes blockchain will have a tremendous positive impact in the future.</p><p>Up until now, he has primarily worked in the healthcare industry building applications to assist doctors, nurses and administrative staff in their jobs, thereby improving patient care in the hospital.</p><p>He is proficient in a variety of programming languages, tools, devops, server administration and is a very quick learner. Erwann likes to write modern (ES6) Javascript code that is clean, understandable and tested, and he also understands P2P, cryptography and networking which will come in handy while working on the ARK Core.</p><p>Erwann’s main role at ARK will be working on Core development. Some of his initial tasks will include bringing up code coverage (test suite) and leading up our quality assurance (QA) (which is a process of determining whether a product or service meets specified requirements).</p><p>He is very excited to join the ARK team and immediately start working - and we are thrilled to have him.

In order to test the new V2 codebase, we have implemented a V2 only DevNet. Please help us test, debug and locate any remaining issues before we prepare migration to the MainNet.</strong></p><p>With the recent announcement of the ARK Core V2 hard fork, we have decided to prepare a v2 only DevNet that will help us squash any final bugs in the codebase. We need help from you, the community, to join us in testing all transaction types, edge cases, stress test and to help us improve things we might have missed by reporting any unusual behaviour.</p><p>Along with the Core, we’ll be working on new items you will notice in the Desktop Wallet and our development team will be preparing a customized “Dynamic Fee” slider in the upcoming days. Dynamic fees are one of the newest additions in the new Core so we must test them thoroughly. This will also help us establish the foundation for the new Desktop Wallet v2 already in development.</p><p>While we test the open DevNet, our core dev team is preparing another internal (closed) network where the v1 MainNet DB will be converted to function as a v2 DB. This will allow us to test for any erroneous transactions or data in the database that might not be compatible with v2 and implement exclusions to avoid issues on MainNet deployment.</p><p>In order to facilitate that process, we’ll need help from currently running MainNet delegates to run this with us. More specifics will follow, but here is a short overview of the process we plan to take:</p><ol><li>Convert v1 MainNet DB to v2 DB.</li><li>Start the network with the converted database.</li><li>Trace the logs for errors.</li><li>Add all exceptions to the exclusion list.
