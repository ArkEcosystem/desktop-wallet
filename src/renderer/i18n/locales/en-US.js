      FINANCE: 'The most important thing for users to know about cryptocurrencies is that they completely reverse the commonly-accepted model of how finance works.',
      BANKS: 'In traditional finance, you give up direct control of your money to a bank. Because banks have control over your money, they can take actions on your behalf, such as refunding transactions and resetting your login info.',

There is also no central location for personal data or funds to be hacked.',

Alternatively, you can use a Ledger Nano S USB hardware device, available at Ledger.com, to store and access your funds and the ARK Desktop Wallet. You can plug your Ledger Nano S into your computer and access the ARK blockchain without needing to enter your passphrase.'

      REMEMBER: 'Remember, anyone who has your passphrase can access your funds. Never share your account with anyone and avoid storing it in locations that are susceptible to hacks, such as the Cloud.'
